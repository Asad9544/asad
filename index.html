    <pre class="movie-description">Fight Club (1999), directed by David Fincher and based on Chuck Palahniuk's novel, follows an unnamed narrator (played by Edward Norton), who suffers from insomnia and dissatisfaction with his consumer-driven life. He forms an underground fight club with the charismatic and anarchistic Tyler Durden (played by Brad Pitt). As the club grows, it spirals into chaos, leading to unexpected and profound consequences for the narratorâ€™s identity and life. The film explores themes of masculinity, consumerism, and identity, with a famous twist that challenges the viewer's perception of reality.</pre>
